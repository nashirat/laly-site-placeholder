// Copy comes from the Pages 'branding' doc, falling back per block to src/lib/mock/branding.ts (see
// src/blocks/branding.ts and getBranding in src/lib/cms.ts). Four of the eight blocks are this
// page's own; the hero, Pricing, FAQ and the closing band are the same blocks /paid-advertising
// uses, carrying this doc's own rows.
//
// The hero photo is the exception on this page — a static import, because it is the layout's 20%
// wash rather than artwork an editor would swap.
//
// The closing CTA is read off the HOME doc, exactly as /paid-advertising does it, so one edit in the
// admin moves all three pages.
//
// Every section but the hero is wrapped in <SectionFade>: one opacity ramp per section, tripped by
// its own observer as it comes on screen (tech lead). The hero is above the fold, so it has nothing
// to fade in from. This is on top of, not instead of, the reveals the sections run on their own
// contents.
