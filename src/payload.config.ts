  // serve. One storage backend, one set of urls, everywhere. The cost is that `bun run seed` and any
  // local /admin upload push real bytes to the Blob store; that's the trade for a coherent DB.

  // 401s. Public urls are <id>.public.blob.vercel-storage.com, which next.config.mjs already allows.
