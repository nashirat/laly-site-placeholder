// Figma 2767:9349 (desktop) / 2739:8985 (mobile) — "The Compound Effect" on /branding. Argument on
// the left, one phase card in the middle, and a vertical progress rail on the right that says which
// phase the card shows.
//
// The section takes the scroll while its phases play: as it settles into the middle of the viewport
// the page stops, each further scroll moves the card up to the next phase, and once the last one is
// reached the scroll is handed straight back. Scrolling up walks them in reverse and hands back at
// the first. Nothing is added to the layout to do it — no tall track, no padding, no sticky, no
// spacer. The section is exactly the height and shape it has always been.
//
// It works because Lenis owns scrolling for this app (SmoothScroll.tsx) and can simply be told to
// stop: while stopped it cancels every wheel and touch event it receives, so the page is genuinely
// frozen. A hand-rolled hijack cannot do this here — our own preventDefault on a wheel listener
// competes with Lenis for the same gesture rather than replacing it, which is why the page kept
// moving. Lenis also emits `virtual-scroll` BEFORE it checks whether it is stopped, so the deltas
// still arrive while the page is held, already normalised across a mouse wheel, a trackpad and a
// touch drag. One code path covers all three.
//
// Deliberately NOT covered: the keyboard, and the scrollbar. Space bar, Page Down, Home/End and a
// scrollbar drag scroll natively, past a stopped Lenis, so the section can never trap anyone — they
// leave on whatever phase it was showing, and the rail is still there to pick the rest. Under
// prefers-reduced-motion Lenis is never constructed, getLenis() is null, and the section falls back
// to the phone's list of all four phases: freezing the page is exactly the kind of motion that
// setting is asking us not to do.
//
// The phone frame has no rail and no picker: it centres the argument and then lists all four
// phases, tab and card, one under the other. So the pin, the rail and the sliding card are md+
// only — that is the mobile design, not a fallback.
//
// The rail's dots are two 28px svgs in Figma; they are a ring, a fill and a 4px dot, so they are
// CSS here rather than two more files in /public.
//
// Same scanline texture over this ground as "The Channels", off the same file and at the same
// opacity — see OVERLAY_OPACITY there for why it is not Figma's 1%.

// The section takes the scroll once its top edge is within this much of a viewport of its resting
// place, and does not re-arm until it has left again — otherwise handing back at the last phase
// would immediately re-take the very next event.
const CATCH = 0.08

// Where the section rests once caught: its top edge flush under the fixed header, measured off the
