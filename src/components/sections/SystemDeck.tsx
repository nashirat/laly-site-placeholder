// The three-card deck in "The System" (Figma 2767:9520 / 2739:8892), cycling the way the client's
// reference does — teak.io/product. That deck is a Framer variant ring: three states, each one
// switching to the next after 3000ms, with every card's scale, y and colour set per state. Ported
// straight: one card is at the front at a time, and every 3s the front card retires to the back
// while the two behind it step forward.
//
// Figma builds the two back cards as scaled instances of the front one, so all three are the same
// markup here and the *slot* owns the scale — not a second set of type sizes. That is also what
// makes them interchangeable, which cycling needs.
//
// Geometry. The three sit in a 3-row grid with no gap, so the rows equalise to the tallest card and
// every flow position is exactly one card height H apart. A card in slot n wants to be at
// n * (H - overlap); it is laid out at d * H, so it is moved by (n - d) * H - n * overlap, and 100%
// of a translate is H. transform-origin is the top edge, so scaling a back card down does not drag
// it off its slot. The grid ends up `2 * overlap` taller than the stack actually draws, which is a
// fixed cqw, so the container takes that back as a negative bottom margin.
const SCALES = [0.909, 0.9569, 1]

// Each channel keeps its own hue and carries it between slots, so the palette belongs to the card
// and only the *state* — tinted and behind, or full and in front — belongs to the slot.
//
// TODO(design): Search shipped a front treatment (the amber), Physical/Social shipped tints, and
// Physical's front lavender came back from review. Everything still marked below is matched by eye
// in the same hue, standing in until the designer gives their own.
