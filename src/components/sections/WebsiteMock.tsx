// The "brand new website" panel graphic (paid.whatYouGet.panels[0]). Still the flat export — the
// client only asked for its CTA to press itself, not for the whole mock to become DOM — so the
// button is the one live part: a patch of the card's own #FFFAF7 covers the baked button, and this
// draws it again on top so it can move without the original showing through the gap.
//
// Geometry is measured off the 1020x518 export and written as percentages of the root box, the same
// way CallsWidget carries its own; radius and type are cqw for the same reason, since the mock is
// 510px in the panel and full-bleed on a phone. The patch is 5px larger than the button on every
// side (in export pixels), which is more than the press ever travels or shrinks.
//
// No client boundary: the press is a CSS animation released by the panel's own <InView> gate.
// ponytail: one button, not a mock rebuilt as components. If a second element ever has to move,
// that is the point to reconsider the export.
