            Two lines are the design, and the break is authored, exactly as Figma has it — the field
            is a textarea, so it is a real \n in the doc. A width cap was the wrong tool: guessing a
            number between "…to nurture" and the full sentence puts the fold at the mercy of the
            font metrics, and it moves the moment the copy is edited.
            md+ only. At mobile's 20px the first line alone overflows a 375 screen, so small screens
            ignore the break and wrap against the 620 cap instead. */}
