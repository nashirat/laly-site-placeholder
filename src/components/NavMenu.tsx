// MENU toggle + the drop-down panel it opens — Figma 3038:1661, now at every width.
//
// The panel drops down from under the header bar carrying its own cream ground and keyline. md+ used
// to get something else entirely: four pills sliding in from the right, staggered, each with its own
// rounded surface. That read as pills floating over whatever was scrolled behind them, which is the
// contrast problem the designer flagged on mobile — so desktop now takes the same sheet. Ground and
// contents both centre at every width; the only thing that changes is the links' axis, stacked on a
// phone and one row across the middle of the sheet at md+.
//
// bajgartoffice.com (the reference the designer sent) grows the panel's height from 0 under the
// bar. This slides the whole sheet down out of the bar instead — same read, but the keyline can
// then leave the same way it arrived rather than vanishing once the height hits 0. Framer runs its
// version as spring(bounce .2, duration .4). Brief here is slower and smooth at both ends: 850ms
// ease-in-out instead of a spring — no overshoot at all, since any overshoot IS the hard stop the
// eye reads at the end. Slightly front-loaded (0.5,0 not 0.37,0) so the tap still feels answered.

  // The dark-hero pages run the bar transparent with a light logo, which is unreadable once this
  // cream sheet is down behind it. styles.css owns that swap off <body>, so this only has to say
  // when the sheet is open — same shape as HeaderGround's data-past-hero.
  //
  // On the way out the flag is held 675ms: the bar stays cream while the sheet is most of the way
  // up, then fades back to transparent, rather than turning transparent over a sheet still sitting
  // over it. It is a timer here rather than a transition-delay in the CSS because that
  // delay would also land on the scroll swap, and scrolling back up into the hero would then sit on
  // a cream bar for most of a second.

      {/* Always mounted (a CSS transition needs both ends rendered) and always full height — the
          panel MOVES rather than growing. An animated clip was the first cut, but a clip has a
          floor: the keyline reaches the header's bottom edge and then has nowhere left to go, so it
          blinks out instead of leaving. Sliding the whole sheet up means the line keeps travelling
          past the edge and gets cut off by this wrapper, which is the same motion the rest of the
          panel makes.
          The wrapper is that cut: a fixed region starting exactly at the header's bottom, clipping
          everything above it. It has to be a separate box because NavMenu renders INSIDE <header> —
          the header is a z-50 stacking context, so nothing in here can paint behind its cream bar,
          and a plain z-index would not have hidden the sheet.
          pointer-events-none on the region, auto on the sheet: the region covers the whole viewport
          below the bar and would otherwise swallow every click on the page with the menu shut.
          `inert` keeps the links out of the tab order and off screen readers while closed. */}

            the logo's bottom edge; ours is a 76px bar that this sheet hangs under, and the logo
            bottoms out 24px above it — so the top inset is the 24 that is left, not another 20. */}
