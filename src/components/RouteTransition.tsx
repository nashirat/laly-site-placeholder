// Route transitions reuse the preloader curtain: it slides up from below to cover, holds while the
// destination finishes loading, then keeps going up to reveal it. Same pink, same logo, same 1.2s
// easeInOutQuint in both directions — the whole point is that a navigation reads as the same gesture
// the page opened with.
//
// This intercepts clicks at the document instead of shipping a <TransitionLink>: every internal
// link on the site is a plain next/link (nav, footer, the Strategy cards' ArrowCircleButton), and a
// wrapper would mean touching all of them and remembering to use it for the next one.
//
// The FETCH starts on click so it overlaps the 1.2s slide and a warm route reveals with no dead hold;
// the COMMIT waits for the cover to finish. Those were the same step once — router.push on click —
// and a warm route then swapped the DOM while the curtain was still on its way up, painting the
// destination into the strip not yet covered, at whatever scroll offset the page happened to be at.
// reveal()'s scrollTo(0, 0) only lands after that, so it read as the target page blinking in
// half-scrolled and then correcting itself. Prefetching on click and pushing under full cover keeps
// the overlap and makes the swap unobservable.
