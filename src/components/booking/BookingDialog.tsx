// The one booking flow behind every "LET'S BEGIN" / "BOOK A CALL" on the site. Mounted once in the

// exists). Three steps: details -> pick a time -> confirmation.
//
// Design: the two-column card comes from Figma 1679:7024 (the login frame) — form left, panel right,
// capped near its 768. Everything ON that card is the marketing system from 2017:5040, NOT the login
// frame's shadcn/Inter kit: Neue Haas display, New Spirit prose, Fira Code labels, #ff6d6a, square
// panels closing on the #544d49 keyline, and the bracketed eyebrow every section already uses. The
// modal opens over the pink Contact section, so Inter in here would read as a different product.
//
// The archived madlib form (182:590) contributed its palette and its underline-only inputs, not its
// pattern — sentence forms wreck screen-reader announcements (fields lose the sentence in forms mode)
// and strand magnifier users on wrapped lines. Plain stacked label/field pairs, brand-dressed.
//
// Research that shaped the flow rather than the paint: a visible step indicator is worth ~20% on
// multi-step completion, so the brackets are a progress meter and not decoration; only the fields
// needed to hold a slot are asked before the booking; slots are 30 minutes, grouped morning/
// afternoon, with the timezone stated rather than assumed; the first free slot is pre-selected.

// Local copy rather than importing ServiceHero's export: this is a client component, and pulling a
// symbol out of that module would drag the whole hero section into the client bundle for an eight
// line mapper. paid-advertising/page.tsx keeps its own copy for the same reason.
