// Disclosure row for the FAQ. Was native <details>/<summary>, which can't animate its own open/close
// anywhere but Chromium (::details-content) — the designer wants the panel to slide at both widths,
// so the state is ours now and the row carries aria-expanded/aria-controls in the element's place.
//
// The slide is `grid-template-rows: 0fr -> 1fr` on a wrapper whose child clips: it animates to the
// answer's real height without anyone measuring it, so nothing breaks when the copy or the width
// changes. max-height would need a magic number that is either too small (clipped) or too large
// (the transition spends most of its time on empty space).
//
// ponytail: each row owns its own open state — the design never closes a sibling, so there is no
// shared state to hoist.
