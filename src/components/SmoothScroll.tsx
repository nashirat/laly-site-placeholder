// working: IntersectionObserver still fires, and the <InView> gates need no proxy/sync shim.
//
// Bails entirely under prefers-reduced-motion. Hijacking the scroll wheel is squarely the kind of
// motion that setting is asking us not to do, and there's no "less smooth" version worth shipping —
// not constructing it at all also means no rAF loop and no wheel listeners for those users.
