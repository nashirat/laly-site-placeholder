// Fallback for the Pages 'development' doc — same contract as mock/branding.ts, and the same reason:
// the page prerenders at build time, so an empty or unreachable database has to render rather than
// fail the build. src/lib/cms.ts falls back to these values a block at a time, so one malformed
// block degrades its own section instead of the page.
//
// Four blocks, not eight: Figma 3292:4643 draws the hero, Pricing, FAQ, Contact and the closing band
// and nothing between them. The sections the other two service pages have in that gap have not been
// designed yet, so nothing here stands in for them — the page is short on purpose.
//
// Keep byte-identical to scripts/seed-development.ts, which writes the same copy into the doc — that
// is what makes the CMS swap verifiable by diffing the rendered page.
