// The home page is ISR (`export const revalidate = 3600` in src/app/(frontend)/page.tsx), so a save
// in /admin stayed invisible on Vercel until that window lapsed. Worse, ISR is
// stale-while-revalidate: the first request after expiry still serves the OLD html and only then
// rebuilds in the background, so an edit needs the window AND two visits to appear. Refreshing twice
// and seeing nothing change is what reads as "the CMS does not update live" — `next dev` has no such
// cache, which is why localhost always looked correct.
//
// Shape is lifted from sia-cms (src/lib/revalidate/frontendRevalidate.ts), minus its locale fan-out:
// the path set is derived from the saved doc's slug. The hook does NOT call revalidatePath
// directly, even though Payload's admin runs inside this same Next app and could. The HTTP hop is
// what lets scripts/seed-paid.ts purge as well — it drives these same collection hooks from plain
// bun, where next/cache has no store and revalidatePath throws. A fetch works from anywhere.
//
// Secret falls back to PAYLOAD_SECRET, so this needs no new Vercel env var to start working.
