/**
 * Seeds the Pages `branding` doc.
 * Run: bun run seed:branding   (bun resolves @payload-config via tsconfig paths and auto-loads .env)
 *
 * TOUCHES NOTHING ELSE — same rule as scripts/seed-paid.ts, and the same reason: the home doc is
 * edited in /admin and the database is its source of truth. The only query here is
 * `where slug equals 'branding'`; a broader one is how the other docs get destroyed.
 *
 * No uploads, unlike seed-paid. Every image on /branding is a static import — the hero's 20% photo
 * wash and two decorative doodles — so this script writes one page doc and nothing else.
 *
 * Copy below is duplicated verbatim from src/lib/mock/branding.ts rather than imported: that module
 * is typed against @/lib/types via a tsconfig path bun does not resolve outside the Next pipeline.
 * The duplication is intentional — the mock is still the per-block fallback in src/lib/cms.ts, so
 * keeping the two byte-identical is what makes the CMS swap verifiable by diffing the rendered page.
 *
 * Idempotent — safe to re-run, and a re-run discards hand edits made to this page in /admin (the doc
 * is delete-then-create).
