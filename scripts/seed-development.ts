/**
 * Seeds the Pages `development` doc.
 * Run: bun run seed:development   (bun resolves @payload-config via tsconfig paths and auto-loads .env)
 *
 * TOUCHES NOTHING ELSE — same rule as scripts/seed-branding.ts, and the same reason: the home doc is
 * edited in /admin and the database is its source of truth. The only query here is
 * `where slug equals 'development'`; a broader one is how the other docs get destroyed.
 *
 * No uploads. The one image on /development is the hero's 20% photo wash, a static import.
 *
 * Four blocks, not eight: Figma 3292:4643 draws the hero, Pricing, FAQ, Contact and the closing band
 * and nothing between them, and Contact is read off the home doc.
 *
 * Copy below is duplicated verbatim from src/lib/mock/development.ts rather than imported: that
 * module is typed against @/lib/types via a tsconfig path bun does not resolve outside the Next
 * pipeline. The duplication is intentional — the mock is still the per-block fallback in
 * src/lib/cms.ts, so keeping the two byte-identical is what makes the CMS swap verifiable by diffing
 * the rendered page.
 *
 * Idempotent — safe to re-run, and a re-run discards hand edits made to this page in /admin (the doc
 * is delete-then-create).
