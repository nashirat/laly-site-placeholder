/**
 * Seeds the Pages `paid-advertising` doc and the four product mocks it renders.
 * Run: bun run seed   (bun resolves @payload-config via tsconfig paths and auto-loads .env)
 *
 * TOUCHES NOTHING ELSE. The home doc is edited in /admin and the database is its source of truth —
 * this script must never delete, rewrite or prune anything outside the four files listed below and
 * the one page doc. Its predecessor (scripts/seed-home.ts, in git history) rebuilt BOTH docs and
 * pruned every Media doc it had not just uploaded; running that today would wipe the home copy and
 * every image behind it. It was deleted rather than left lying around.
 *
 * Copy below is duplicated verbatim from src/lib/mock/paid.ts rather than imported: that module
 * static-imports .webp files, which bun cannot resolve outside the Next pipeline — importing it
 * would kill this script at parse time. The duplication is intentional: the mock is still the
 * per-block fallback in src/lib/cms.ts, so keeping the two byte-identical is what makes the CMS swap
 * verifiable by diffing the rendered page.
 *
 * Idempotent — safe to re-run, and a re-run discards hand edits made to this page in /admin (the
 * doc is delete-then-create). It re-uploads the four mocks to Vercel Blob every time.
